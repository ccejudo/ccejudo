## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am a third year Computational Engineering student at [TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey CSF](https://tec.mx/en) with an interest in Full-Stack development, Cloud, and Machine Learning. Experienced with different technologies, quick learner and adaptable. 

I believe that the skills that I have acquire from different work experiences make me a good leader, and I am always trying to apply and polish them in any opportunity that comes in my way.
